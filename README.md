# FakeStreamChat
Creating a basic fake stream chat for my friend group's DnD. The idea is to trascribe audio live, and use a combination of rule based systems and LLM generations to create fake twitch comments.

```bash
  make install
```
    
## Deployment

To test out the live transcription. TODO: Add other tests and main file.
